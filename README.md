# Python Mini Projects

Two mini projects were done as a part of workshop on Python/Biopython for Bioinformatics organized by Center for Bioinformatics Learning Advancement and Systematics Training (cBLAST), Department of Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, University of Dhaka. These two mini projects consist of calculation and visualization of window-based DNA base stacking energy and propeller twist with respect to base pair index for a given DNA sequence of fasta format.
